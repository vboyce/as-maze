# as-maze

This is a collection of multiple check-of-concept / pilot studies related to fellowship applications. 

# Organization

* as-maze is a loose replication of Altmann and Steedman 1988 (expt 2) in Maze (with adults)
* kpath-maze is a check of visual context on kindergarten-path effects with materials inspired from Weighall (2008) (with adults)
* tundra-maze is a proof-of-concept for using Maze with children (a few child and adult pilot subjects on a paragraph read in Maze) 
* write-ups contains the HSP2025 abstract reporting on the as-math and kpath-maze findings.

The first two of these are relevant to the HSP presentation.
