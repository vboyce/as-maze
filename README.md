# as-maze
Loose Replication of Altmann and Steedman 1988 in Maze

# Trials / person etc

There are 32 items / 4 conditions

A&S do 48 fillers (of "varying" similarity)

Timing wise, one item in Maze is 15-20-15 words @ 800ms per word that's 40 seconds

so all 32 would be 21ish min + intro/outro which is pushing it too long and repetitive

if we do half items we still get 4/condition/person (not ideal...) and 10ish min + intro/outro

and then we can ask for what was this task probing? to check

2.6 / person for 16 data points (.16 / item)

how many people should be run / how many items? 

# Data collection
